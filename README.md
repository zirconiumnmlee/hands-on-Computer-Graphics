### Simple Raytracer

File folder 'raytracer' is a simple raytracer from Scratchpixel;

In order to get the graphics we render,enter the dictionary `.\raytracer`in terminal, then:

To compile raytracer.cpp:

`c++ -O3 -o raytracer.exe raytracer.cpp`

> You can change the name and location of the output file in function render.The default name is raytracer.ppm in now dictionary.

To run raytracer.exe:

`./raytracer.exe`

We will see file `raytracer.ppm` in now dictionary after running.

Open the .ppm file in Photoshop to see it and save its .png file:

![raytracer](.\raytracer\raytracer.png)
